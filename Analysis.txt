JavaScript-and-DOM-Manipulation
This project is a simple example of using D3 to manipulate the DOM and create a table from a small amount of data stored in a JavaScript file. The user can interactively filter the data by any number of parameters and the app.js file will manipulate the DOM and create a table based on the filters.
